# Traffic Light Identification and Classification Repo

- main - setup dataset  
- start_training - train the model  
- test_model - run inference  
  - set "source" variable to whatever files to run it on
  - Change device to 'cpu' if you want to run on CPU rather than CUDA device
- data_transform - run after inference begins  

To setup pipeline:  

- Start test_model.py file on a video
- run data_transform.py after test_model.py is running inference
